# Bayesian inference and information theory
## Marginal likelihood derivation and approximation for the Beta-Binomial
Following in the roots of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) derivation, we explore the theoretical foundations and practical examples of deriving a closed form solution for the marginal likelihood and approximating its integral using Taylor expansions. The scenaria we study are for the Beta-Binomial with two sets of priors: the Beta(1,1) (uniform) prior and the Jeffreys prior.Check out the notebook [here](https://github.com/JonnaBuri/Elements_of_AI-image_classification/blob/main/Image%20classification%20with%20LR%2C%20MLP%2C%20CNNs%20(Elements%20of%20AI%20demo%20session).ipynb)!
