## Marginal likelihood derivation and approximation for the Beta-Binomial
Following in the roots of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) derivation, we explore the theoretical foundations and practical examples of deriving a closed form solution for the marginal likelihood and approximating its integral using Taylor expansions. The scenaria we study are for the Beta-Binomial with two sets of priors: the Beta(1,1) (uniform) prior and the Jeffreys prior.
